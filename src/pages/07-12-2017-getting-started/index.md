title: "Common Mistakes Developers Should Avoid"
---


Hello World this is my first blog post on my personal site. From a long time I was in pursuit that I 
should start maintaining my Dev blog and share my experiences about work and life. So finally after 
a long time I bought a domain and decided to create my website from scratch, I have two reasons to 
start this blog, firstly I wanted to create my personal site, I see many Developer have their 
personal site where they mention about their work experiences, and another reason being I wanted
to reach to Dev Community though my blog posts, I know there are be many ways to do so, 

You can argue why not Twitter or Medium, well I have reason for that Twitter is a micro blogging site
so you cannot write a detailed blog post, it can be used to share an update in few words so Twitter isn't 
a good idea, why not Medium ? Well, medium is not wrong choice however, my idea was to create everything
from scratch being a developer myself I wanted to take this as a challenge to keep my Tech skills relevant,
you would surely agree that after a while some of the skills we learn fade away, by creating everything
from scractch it gave me oppurtunity to learn new framework like Gatsby JS which is used as a static site 
generator for creating static websites, also with Gatsby I get to code in ReactJS, so another plus, thirdly I learned about GraphQL which is also created by Facebook and lastly I learned about hosting and maintaing my site, which is also good learning for Tech architect Associate, by the way I recently got this certification, and I am very passionate about Tech Architecures, it always facinates me how web works, how many things come into play for making simple functionality work, it just blows my mind.

Enough talk already now let me delve into the actual topic of this blog post, over the few years of my developer experience I have learned from some of the mistakes I did

1) Always Use Spring Bean to autowire classes rather using static methods in Classes.

2) Never author Implmentation rather use Interface for autowiring.

3) Use Static methods only if the classes are in same package.
