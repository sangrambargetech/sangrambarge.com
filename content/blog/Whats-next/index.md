2020 haven't been good for many of us given the pandemic we are in currently and things don't look to 
be getting better any time sooner.

What I believe is when life gives you lemons make the most out of it, look at the situation positively.
Remember every crisis brings the best out of us. Take this as an oppourunity to learn something new, improvise on the existing skills, spend 
more time with family, give sometime to yourself.

I love to spread motivation and that's why for 2020 I have decided to focus on self learning and Motivating myself and also spreading 
positivity in every little way I could.

### My Learning plans for 2020 
AWS
React JS

Yes I have enrolled for AWS associate developer course and I am enjoying the course so far. I started this course a week back and so far 
completed IAM and EC2 services, AWS is quite a fun than I thought. 

ReactJS, well this has been on my list from a very long time, altough I know how React JS works and I also have created amazing stuff with 
React however I would still say I have a lot of ground to cover, there are plenty of things to be explored, so I will be doing that in the 
days to come. 

Follow my journey on Twitter. I always keep tweeting about my Tech journey.
